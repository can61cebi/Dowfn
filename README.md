## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-threaded Downloading:** Splits files into chunks and downloads them using multiple threads to maximize download speed.
- **Modern UI:** An intuitive and easy-to-use desktop application built with `Slint`.
- **Pause and Resume:** Pause your downloads at any time and resume them later from where you left off.
- **Browser Integration:** Directly capture downloads from your browser and manage them through the application with the browser extension.
- **Real-time Statistics:** Track instant download speed, amount of data downloaded, and remaining time.
- **Purely Rust:** Leverages the power of Rust for performance, safety, and concurrency.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The project is developed modularly within a Rust workspace:

- **`dowfn-core`**: The heart of the application. It contains all the core logic, such as download management, chunk handling, pause/resume functionality, and file merging. It runs fully asynchronously with `Tokio`.
- **`dowfn-app`**: The desktop GUI developed with the `Slint` framework. It communicates with `dowfn-core` via `mpsc` channels.
- **`dowfn-shared`**: Contains common data structures (models, protocols) used across different components of the project (core, app, extension).
- **`dowfn-extension`**: The browser extension developed for browsers. It captures download links and sends them to the main application.
- **`dowfn-native-host`**: The native messaging host that enables communication between the browser extension and the desktop application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Core Language:** [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- **Asynchronous Runtime:** [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/)
- **GUI Framework:** [Slint](https://slint.rs/)
- **Browser Extension:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS
